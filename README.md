# in-app-calling
This repository demonstrate mock layouts created in jetpack compose for call screens[Gemini Generated]. Recently when I needed them for urgent POC, I've been struggling to find basic screens with clean ui. Hence I'm putting this across so, anyone wants to refer to in-app calling Android Jetpack compose can use this and save their time while doing POCs.
